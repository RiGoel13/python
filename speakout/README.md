#Speak Out â€“ Python Text-to-Speech using Windows SAPI#
This is a basic voice assistant created with Python and Microsoft's Speech API (SAPI) on Windows. It lets users input text and listen to it read out.

bash
What can i speak for you: Hello, how are you? (Speaks: "Hello, how are you?")

The script works only on Windows because it utilizes SAPI.SpVoice.
To make it cross-platform, you may look into libraries such as pyttsx3.
